Changing your mind can make any words true, so mind yourself and the words you use.

I recently made the independent observation that this universe is made up of 10 conceivable dimensions.  
This includes the 3rd, experienced by humans using 5 "separate" senses.  
It is my contention that there is no veil but our own perception, and with the proper exercise one may extend their watchful gaze upon a 'closer-to-whole' realm of perspective. 
granting the bearer of this gaze to have more peace than was previously possible while 
incorrectly viewing our current wokring universes as strictly 3 dimensional; a truly laughable concept that many of us unwittingly believe.
Alathough upon dissection, this                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Here is a frail representation of the model of our universe AS IT PERTAINS TO HUMAN PERCEPTION.  
It's base 10, like Super String Theory suggests.  
Remember - YOU ARE THE CENTER OF YOUR UNIVERSE, and the succession of dimensions is observed from your center on out, beginning here:  
| # dimension | name | method of perception |  
1st Dimension - x axis - Existence  
2nd Dimension - y axis - Awareness  
3rd Dimension - space - Knowledge  
4th Dimension - time - Wisdom  
5th Dimension - probability - Imagination  
6th Dimension - intention - Will  
7th Dimension - chaos - Magic  
8th Dimension - infinity - God  
9th Dimension - spiral - Oneness  
0th Dimension - zero - Nothing  
  
...I hope this helps someone who is as confused as I was, and allows you to deal with the overwhelming absurdity of living in a 3 dimensional world 
with 3 dimensional people as the illusion that it is. It is important not to neglect the fact that our bodies travel in many dimensions at once and are prone to fracture, so to concern oneself with only one or two directions of movement is of the utmost folly!
Time and probablities are just as much physical locations as left and right, up or down, back and forth and should be observed accordingly.
