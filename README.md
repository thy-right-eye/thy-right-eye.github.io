# don't panic

I recently made the independent observation that this universe is made up of 10 conceivable dimensions.  
This includes the 3rd, experienced by humans using 5 "separate" senses.  
Apparently somehow I had limited myself to the observation of only 3 up until now, distracted by the 5 senses and needs of the human host.
I believed that I, myself, was my body and experienced life in this way.  
The mind and body stagnate in 3D.
It is my contention that there is no veil but our own perception in between extra dimensions, and we are therefore incorrectly viewing our immediate surroundings as strictly 3 dimensional.  
This leads to many adverse mental conditions:  
Anxiety being defined as 'attempting to occupy a time/space in the certain/probable future relative to when your physical body resides'  
Depression exactly described as 'attempting to occupy a time/space in the certain/probable past relative to when your physical body resides'  
One must position themselves in the center of their timeline, and know what they are leaving behind, where they are headed and where they are now.    
Most importantly then is to TRAVEL WITH INTENTION.  
We are complex beings created out of contradiction, ironically driven to attain some form of stasis by instinct.  
It is no small feat to gather yourselves in your entirety and focus all of your intentions in one direction. Maybe this is what it means to align your will with god's.  
What this means is that at any given time, you are devoted to what you are doing. You want to be there, and you are being honest about it.  
Akin to Kundalini awakening, this sort of drive can tear your life asunder. Sometimes in a good way, sometimes not.
Here is a frail representation of the model of our universe AS IT PERTAINS TO HUMAN PERCEPTION.  
It's base 10, like Super String Theory suggests.  
Remember - YOU ARE THE CENTER OF YOUR UNIVERSE, and the succession of dimensions is observed from your center on out, beginning here:  
| # dimension | name | method of perception |  
1st Dimension - x axis - Existence  
2nd Dimension - y axis - Awareness  
3rd Dimension - space - Knowledge  
4th Dimension - time - Wisdom  
5th Dimension - probability - Imagination  
6th Dimension - intention - Will  
7th Dimension - chaos - Magic  
8th Dimension - infinity - God  
9th Dimension - spiral - Oneness  
0th Dimension - zero - Nothing  
  
Obviously, for human-sized exploits largely taking place on Earth, not much beyond the first 6 dimensions is practically necessary or useful  
for worldly means or ends!  
...I hope this helps someone who is as confused as I am, and assists you to deal with the overwhelming absurdity of living in a 3 dimensional 
world with 3 dimensional people as the illusion that it is, but doesn't have to be. It is important not to neglect the fact that our bodies
inhabit space in at least 6 dimensions, not only 3, and are prone to distinct damage in each one, so to concern oneself with only one or two
directions of movement is dangerous to your health.
Time and probablities are just as much physical locations as left and right, up or down, back and forth and should be observed accordingly.  

Changing your mind can make any words true, so mind yourself and the words you use.
