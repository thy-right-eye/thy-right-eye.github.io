# don't panic

I recently made the independent observation that this universe is made up of 10 conceivable dimensions.  
This includes the first 3, experienced by humans using 5 "separate" senses.  
Apparently somehow I had limited myself to the observation of only 3 up until now, distracted by the 5 senses and needs of the human host.
But spatial awareness is more than 3 dimensional.  
Here is a frail representation of the model of our universe AS IT PERTAINS TO HUMAN PERCEPTION.  
It's base 10, like Super String Theory suggests.  
Remember - YOU ARE LITERALLY THE CENTER OF YOUR UNIVERSE, and the succession of dimensions is observed from your center on out, beginning here:  

>| # dimension | name | method of perception |  
>1st Dimension - x axis - Existence  
>2nd Dimension - y axis - Awareness  
>3rd Dimension - space - Knowledge  
>4th Dimension - time - Wisdom  
>5th Dimension - probability - Imagination  
>6th Dimension - intention - Will  
>7th Dimension - chaos - Magic  
>8th Dimension - infinity - God  
>9th Dimension - spiral - Oneness  
>0th Dimension - zero - Nothing

I will attempt to explain:  
For most of my life, time remained an absract concept that is anything but consistent and I believed that I, myself, was my material vessel and experienced life in this way.  
I could not figure out why for some reason no matter what I wanted to do, I would just repeat the same behaviors every day until for some reason the universe would bless me with seemingly random change.  
The mind and body stagnate in 3D.
It is my contention that there is no veil but our own perception, and we are therefore incorrectly viewing our immediate surroundings as strictly 3 dimensional.  
This potentially leads to adverse mental conditions because we are not aware of how our thoughts and emotions influence reality, but this awareness can be restored.
Anxiety being defined as 'attempting to occupy a time/space in the certain/possible **future** relative to when your physical body resides'  
Depression described as 'attempting to occupy a time/space in the certain/possible **past** relative to when your physical body resides'  
All of this may seem obvious until you look at a human's behaviour. One may say they "know" these facts, but when strictly speaking based on observed behavior, the conclusion is that no, they don't know how this works.
One must look up from their position in the center of their timeline, and possess enough knowledge to be aware of how they got there and where they are headed.    
To gain this **wisdom** one must first attain *knowledge* of their domain so they can master their surroundings.  
Expertly navigating the 3 dimensions of the physical realm is absolutely necessary. But it is far from the end of your journey to mastering yourself.
Most importantly then is to set your INTENTION. 
This is the only way to effectively navigate your consciousness amidst the different probabilities.
We are complex beings created out of contradiction, ironically driven to attain some form of stasis by instinct.  
The mastery of the martial arts of the 5 senses is necessary for any successful vehicle of humanity regardless of it's destination.
We may perform whatever actions we like, but our intentions always show in the end.
We need Knowledge of our surroundings, Wisdom from the past and for the future, Imagination of different possibilities and the Will to follow an intentional eventuality to succeed in fulfilling whatever destiny we desire.
It is necessary to include these additional senses of direction to the 5 we already use in our perception of the world around us, because  it is no small feat to gather your selves in your entirety and focus all of your intentions in one direction. To have one true intention.  
Maybe this is what it means to align your will with god's.  
What it *does* mean is that to be aware is to be intentionally doing what you are doing. Your existence at that point in time and space is a conscious decision made after considering all other possibilities that are truly available and is serving the higher purpose of allowing you to sow chaos/order in the particular fashion one is only capable of themselves. 
Not a complacent state of least resistance.
It is in this way that you must complete everything you wish to do.
Almost like a real Kundalini awakening, this sort of awareness when truly attained often tears your life apart. Sometimes in a good way, sometimes not. Depends on where you are.
Real truths do not ease the burning of existence but bring the pain of clarity.
  
Obviously, for human-sized exploits largely taking place on Earth, not much beyond the first 6 dimensions is practically necessary or useful  
for worldly means or ends!  
...I hope this helps someone who is as confused as I am, and assists you to deal with the overwhelming absurdity of living in a 3 dimensional 
world with 3 dimensional people as the illusion that it is, but doesn't have to be. Life is not a diorama, it is dynamic. Do not neglect the fact that our bodies
inhabit space in at least 6 dimensions, not merely 3, and are prone to distinct damage from missteps in each one, so to concern yourself with only one or two
directions of movement is dangerous to your health and lifespan.
Times and probabilities are just as much physical locations as left and right, up or down, back and forth - and so should be observed accordingly. Or at the very least, not ignored and denied for what they are by those who can afford that luxury while others needlessly suffer.

Changing your mind can make any words true, so mind yourself and the words you use.
