Changing your mind can make any words true, so mind yourself and the words you use.

I recently made the independent observation that this universe is made up of 10 conceivable dimensions.  
This includes the 3rd, experienced by humans using 5 "separate" senses.  
It is my contention that there is no veil but our own perception, and with the proper exercise one may 'gaze' upon a wider realm of perspective,  
granting the bearer of this sight with more peace than is possible while incorrectly viewing our individual universes as "only" 3 dimensional,  
a truly laughable concept that many of us unwittingly believe.  
Here is a frail representation of the model of our universe AS IT PERTAINS TO HUMAN PERCEPTION.  
It's base 10, like Super String Theory suggests.  
Remember - YOU ARE THE CENTER OF YOUR UNIVERSE, and the succession of dimensions is observed from your center on out, beginning here:  
| # dimension | name | method of perception |  
1st Dimension - x axis - Existence  
2nd Dimension - y axis - Awareness  
3rd Dimension - space - Knowledge  
4th Dimension - time - Wisdom  
5th Dimension - probability - Imagination  
6th Dimension - intention - Will  
7th Dimension - chaos - Magic  
8th Dimension - infinity - God  
9th Dimension - spiral - Oneness  
0th Dimension - zero - Nothing  
  
...I hope this helps someone who is as confused as I was, and allows you to deal with the overwhelming absurdity of living in a 3 dimensional world 
with 3 dimensional people as the illusion that it is.
